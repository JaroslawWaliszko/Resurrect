#Resurrect

Visual Studio extension which attach debugger to previously debugged processes. The extension is compatible with Visual Stutio 2012. Attach operation is based on names of the processes. Both native and managed debugging engines are always used. If we have opened multiple VS instances, the plugin across all of them is aware of recently debugged processes regardless of which instance was used as the last. All necessery data is stored in registry. For some more information including the brief usage description look [here](https://github.com/JaroslawWaliszko/Resurrect/blob/master/docs/resurrect_manual.pdf?raw=true).
