#Resurrect

Visual Studio extension which allows to attach debugger to previously debugged processes. Attach operation is based on names of the processes. Both native and managed debugging engines are always used (you can debug through c# and c++ code during the same debugging session). Processes to be re-attached are correlated with solutions to which they had been previously attached. Information about recently attached targets is almost immediately known across all Visual Studio instances opened at once. Resurrect uses system registry as a data storage. If you want the compiled artifact, grab it from [here](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/043c7c91-e127-4616-bce0-39b869cee4b3).
