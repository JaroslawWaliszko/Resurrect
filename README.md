#Resurrect

Visual Studio extension which resurrects debugging session with previously debugged processes re-attached. Previously chosen debugging engines are also remembered. Attach operation is based on names of the processes. Processes to be re-attached are correlated with solutions to which they had been previously attached. Information about recently attached targets is almost immediately known across all Visual Studio instances opened at once. Resurrect uses system registry as a data storage. If you want the compiled artifact, grab it from [here](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/043c7c91-e127-4616-bce0-39b869cee4b3).
