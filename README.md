#Resurrect

Visual Studio extension which allows to attach debugger to previously debugged processes. Attach operation is based on names of the processes. Both native and managed debugging engines are always used. Processes to be re-attached are related to specific solutions, to which they had been previously attached. If there are multiple VS instances opened in parallel, plugins across all them are always aware of recently attached processes, no matter which instance was used as the last. All necessery data is stored in registry. It is compatible with Visual Stutio 2012 and 2013.
